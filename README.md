# PlayerVaults
Per-player inventory-based vaults plugin for GenisysPro


## What does this plugin do?
This plugin allows you to add PlayerVaults in to the game, like on the MCPC version of the game.
We've made compatibilitie for GenisysPro, or forks in general, to come to terms with these standards.
Every plugin which is useful and made, and is not compatible with forks, we try and make them compatible with forks, but our main compatibility is for GenisysPro. All the plugins we make compatible with Forks, should also work on other forks like Tesseract or any other forks.

## Compatible MCPE versions
This plugin is compatible with all latest versions from 1.1.x or upwards.
We try and make all MCPE Version compatibility so you can use these plugins without any worry of updating your server, meaning plugins could break. If however they do break when updating to another MCPE version, or a buggy one, then let us know. We'll try updating the plugins to the latest. Thanks, and enjoy!
